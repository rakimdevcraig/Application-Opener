have to bring over the code I have on windows to open windows programs also
at first I can seperate that code into a method called 'openwindows program'
but eventually I want to try and have the same method to open files on both computers
ask mark if I need a constructor or anything in the top part of the class and if classes are the best way 
to do this because I saw someone else use module.exports for an async function (line 21)
https://github.com/sindresorhus/open/blob/master/index.js
he also used process.platform to check what operating system was being used (line 50)
I might have to add that in when I try to make it one method
